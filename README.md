> **Empowering teams to leverage AI coding assistants for faster, higherâ€‘quality software deliveryâ€”with the right context, workflows, and guardrails.**

## Purpose

Learn how to give GitHub Copilot more tools to expand the capabilities of your development workflow by integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) with a Slalom consulting capabilities management system. This exercise demonstrates how AI can streamline consulting operations while teaching core MCP concepts.

## Quick Start (Skill Lab)

1. Click the "Use This Template" button to create a repository in your own GitHub account.
2. After the template unpacks, open the Actions tab in your new repo - a GitHub Actions workflow should start automatically.
3. When the workflow completes, a GitHub Issue will be created in your respository to guide the next steps of the lab.

That's it. The lab automation (workflow + seeded issue) is the only thing you need to verify to begin.

## If Something Doesn't Happen

If you do NOT see a workflow run within ~30 seconds of creating your new repo:

- Refresh the Actions tab once
- Ensure Actions are enabled for your repository (Repository Settings > Actions)
- Manually trigger any visible workflow if it shows a "Run workflow" button

If the expected Issue wasn't created after the workflow succeeds:

- Open the workflow run log and look for any failed steps
- Re-run the workflow (top-right "Re-run jobs")

## Next Steps After Automation

Once the Issue appears, follow its guidance to work through the exercise using Copilot Agent mode.

## What You'll Learn & Build

- **Who is this for**: Slalom consultants, developers, and teams looking to enhance their AI-assisted workflows
- **What you'll learn**: MCP basics, GitHub MCP server setup, and integration with Copilot Agent Mode for consulting scenarios
- **What you'll build**: A capabilities management system for Slalom consultants that uses GitHub Copilot to manage issues while upgrading the consulting capabilities platform
- **Prerequisites**: Basic knowledge of [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) - see the [Getting Started with Copilot](https://github.com/skills/getting-started-with-github-copilot) exercise if needed
- **How long**: This exercise takes less than one hour to complete

In this exercise, you will:

1. Integrate a GitHub MCP server with GitHub Copilot for consulting scenarios
2. Delegate Copilot to research similar consulting platforms and open improvement issues
3. Ask Copilot to find an important capability enhancement and implement it from idea to pull request
4. Experience AI-assisted consulting workflow automation

## Tech Stack Snapshot

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (transitioning to React-based capabilities dashboard)
- Backend: Python FastAPI (consulting capabilities management)
- MCP Integration: GitHub MCP Server
- AI Assistant: GitHub Copilot with Agent Mode
- Package management: pip/requirements.txt

## Learning Objectives

This exercise demonstrates practical applications of MCP in professional consulting environments:
- Capability tracking and management for consulting teams
- AI-assisted project planning and issue management
- Integration of MCP servers with business workflows
- Professional dashboard development for client-facing applications
