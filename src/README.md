## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                                                          | Description                                                         |

## Data Model

The application uses a consulting-focused data model:

1. **Capabilities** - Uses capability name as identifier:
   - Description of the consulting capability
   - Skill levels (Emerging, Proficient, Advanced, Expert)
   - Practice area (Strategy, Technology, Operations)
   - Industry verticals served
   - Required certifications
   - List of consultant emails registered
   - Available capacity (hours per week)
   - Geographic location preferences

2. **Consultants** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Practice area
   - Skill level
   - Certifications
   - Availability

All data is currently stored in memory for this learning exercise. In a production environment, this would be backed by a robust database system.

## Future Enhancements

This exercise will guide you through implementing:
- Capability maturity assessments
- Intelligent team matching algorithms  
- Analytics dashboards for practice leads
- Integration with project management systems
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
