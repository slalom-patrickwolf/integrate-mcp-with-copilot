# Enhanced User Experience & Interface Design

Now that we have expanded our consulting capabilities significantly, the current interface layout is becoming unwieldy. The capabilities list is too long and the registration process is disconnected from the capability information.

## Proposed UI/UX Improvements

### Layout Optimization
- Move capability cards to a more prominent central position
- Remove the separate registration form and integrate action buttons directly on each capability card
- Implement a card-based layout with better visual hierarchy

### Enhanced Capability Cards
- Add "Register Expertise" button directly on each capability card
- Include quick-view consultant capacity and availability
- Show skill level indicators and certification requirements
- Add visual indicators for practice areas (Technology, Strategy, Operations)

### Professional Polish
- Ensure the interface meets Slalom's client-presentation standards
- Optimize for use during client capability discussions
- Implement responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Add subtle Byte mascot elements for brand consistency

### Accessibility & Usability
- Improve navigation for consultants managing multiple capabilities
- Add keyboard navigation support
- Ensure color contrast meets accessibility standards
- Include tooltips for complex capability information

Absolutely agree! I'm having trouble finding my expertise areas quickly during client calls.
This is exactly what we need. The current interface isn't quite ready for client demonstrations.
Mobile optimization is crucial - I often need to check capabilities while traveling to client sites.erface

Now that we have many activities, the list on the left is too long so it is hard to navigate. And the add dialog is far away from the activity.

- Move the cards to the bottom

- Remove the registration form and replace it with a "register student" button on each activity card.

- Make sure it looks good on desktop and phone.

I second this idea. I'm having trouble finding my activity.
100% support this. Nice idea! Looking forward to the update.
Don't forget about tablet's too.
