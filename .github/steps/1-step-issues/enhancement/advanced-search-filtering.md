# Advanced Capability Search & Filtering

The current capabilities list lacks organization and search functionality, making it difficult for practice leads to find specific expertise or available consultants efficiently.

## Proposed Enhancements

Add a comprehensive search and filtering toolbar above the capability cards:

### Filter Options
- **Practice Area**: Strategy, Technology, Operations
- **Industry Vertical**: Healthcare, Financial Services, Retail, Manufacturing, etc.
- **Skill Level**: Emerging, Proficient, Advanced, Expert
- **Availability**: Filter by consultants with available capacity
- **Certification Status**: Show only capabilities with specific certifications

### Sorting Options
- Alphabetical by capability name
- By available capacity (hours per week)
- By number of registered consultants
- By practice area grouping

### Search Functionality
- Free text search across capability names and descriptions
- Consultant name search
- Skills and certification keyword search

## Technical Requirements

Ensure responsive design works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices for use in client meetings and on-the-go capability planning.

This would be incredibly valuable for project staffing decisions. We need this before our capabilities list grows even larger.
Absolutely! I'd love to contribute to this. I just completed our internal React training program. â˜•
