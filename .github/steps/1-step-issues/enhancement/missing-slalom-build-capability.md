# üö® Missing Critical Capability: Slalom Build

The Slalom Build capability is missing from the capabilities management platform.

During last week's leadership meeting, our practice leads announced the integration of Slalom Build capabilities to meet growing client demand for product development and digital innovation. However, when consultants try to register for this capability, it's not available in the system.

I can see several other technology capabilities are properly configured:

- ‚úÖ Cloud Architecture
- ‚úÖ Data Analytics  
- ‚úÖ DevOps Engineering
- ‚úÖ Cybersecurity

## ‚è±Ô∏è Urgency

This is time-sensitive as we have several client proposals requiring Slalom Build expertise due next week. Multiple consultants have experience in product development, design thinking, and agile delivery methodologies and are ready to be registered.

Current consulting demand includes:
- Product strategy and roadmapping
- User experience design and research
- Agile product development
- Digital product innovation
- Design thinking workshops
- Product management consulting
- Full-stack development capabilities
- Product analytics and optimization

## üí° Expected Outcome

The Slalom Build capability should be added with appropriate:
- Skill level definitions (Emerging through Expert)
- Required certifications (Product Management, Agile certifications)
- Industry vertical mappings (especially consumer products, fintech, healthtech)
- Capacity planning for upcoming product development engagements
- Integration with our broader consulting and technology practices

This capability is essential for our full-service offering that combines strategy, technology, and product development expertise.
