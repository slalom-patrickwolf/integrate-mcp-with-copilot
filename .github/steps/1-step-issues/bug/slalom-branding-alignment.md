# Slalom Branding Alignment Issues

The current website doesn't properly reflect Slalom's corporate branding and visual identity standards.

## Issues Identified:

1. **Color Scheme**: The current blue palette doesn't match Slalom's official brand colors (#003d7a, #0066cc)
2. **Missing Brand Elements**: Our adorable Byte mascot should be prominently featured throughout the platform
3. **Professional Polish**: The interface needs consulting-grade visual refinement for client demonstrations

## Suggestions:

- Update the color scheme to match Slalom's brand guidelines
- Integrate Byte mascot images from https://colby-timm.github.io/images/ collection
- Add subtle animations that reflect our innovative consulting approach (maybe flowing data visualization elements?)
- Ensure the platform looks professional enough for client showcases

This is important for maintaining brand consistency across all Slalom digital properties and ensuring we present a polished image to clients who may see this platform during capability discussions.
